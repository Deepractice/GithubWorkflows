# Workflow Improvements from Issue #69

## Overview
This document summarizes the workflow improvements implemented to address the issues identified in Issue #69.

## Improvements Made

### 1. PR Command Execution
- **Problem**: Commands posted in PR comments were not executing
- **Solution**: Removed the `github.event.issue.pull_request == null` restriction from `/start pr` and `/start release` commands
- **Impact**: Commands can now be executed from both Issue and PR comments

### 2. Auto-delete Feature Branches
- **Problem**: Feature branches remained after PR merge
- **Solution**: Added automatic deletion in `pr-merged-develop.yml`
- **Impact**: Cleaner repository with automatic cleanup

### 3. Auto-delete Release Branches
- **Problem**: Release branches remained after merge to main
- **Solution**: Added automatic deletion in `pr-merged-main.yml`
- **Impact**: Automatic cleanup of release branches

### 4. PR Opened to Main Event
- **Problem**: Beta releases not auto-triggered when PR opened to main
- **Solution**: Fixed bot detection to allow `github-actions[bot]`
- **Impact**: Automatic beta releases work correctly

### 5. Prerelease Lock Cleanup
- **Problem**: `prerelease.lock` file not cleaned after release
- **Solution**: Added cleanup logic to clean from develop branch
- **Impact**: Proper version management without stale lock files

### 6. Branch Synchronization
- **Problem**: Changes not synced back from main to develop
- **Solution**: Added automatic sync PR creation after release
- **Impact**: Branches stay in sync automatically

### 7. Sync Script Improvement
- **Problem**: Cherry-pick causing branch divergence
- **Solution**: Changed to use merge instead of cherry-pick
- **Impact**: Consistent commit history across branches

## Testing
All improvements have been tested using the local test framework with `act`.

## Next Steps
Monitor the workflows in production to ensure all improvements work as expected.
