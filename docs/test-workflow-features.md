# Test Workflow Features

## Purpose
This file is created to test the new workflow features implemented from Issue #69.

## Features to Test

### 1. Auto-delete Feature Branch
- When this PR is merged to develop, the feature/#74-issue branch should be automatically deleted

### 2. Auto-generate Changeset
- When PR is created to develop, a changeset should be automatically generated

### 3. PR Command Execution
- Commands can now be executed from PR comments (not just Issue comments)

### 4. Release Flow
- After PR merges to develop, `/start release --preview` should be triggered
- Release branch auto-deletion after merge to main
- Auto-sync from main back to develop

## Test Steps
1. Create PR with `/start pr` command
2. Observe auto-changeset generation
3. Merge PR and watch branch deletion
4. Check if release preview is triggered

## Expected Results
- ✅ Branch auto-deleted after merge
- ✅ Changeset auto-generated
- ✅ Commands work in PR comments
- ✅ Release flow automated
