# Transparent Event-Driven Architecture

## Overview
This document demonstrates the new transparent event-driven architecture.

## Key Features
- All automation triggers commands via comments
- Users can see the complete execution chain
- Every action is traceable and auditable

## Benefits
1. **Transparency**: No hidden operations
2. **Control**: Users can intervene at any point
3. **Consistency**: All features are commands
4. **Debuggability**: Complete visibility into what's happening

## Example Flow
```
Event → Bot Notice → Command → Execution → Result
```

All visible in PR/Issue comments!
